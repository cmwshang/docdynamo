        <title>Usage Overview</title>

        <p>{[project]} uses XML files as the basis for the documentation to be generated. A minimum of two files are needed: </p>

        <list>
            <list-item>A manifest that defines the documents to load and render.</list-item>

            <list-item>Source file(s) that are the documents themselves.</list-item>
        </list>

        <!-- SECTION => USAGE OVERVIEW - MANIFEST -->
        <section id="manifest">
            <title>Manifest File</title>

            <p>The manifest.xml file is required to exist in the doc directory; it defines the documents to load and render.
System wide variables are also declared by using the <b>&amp;lt;variable&amp;gt;</b> tag. A variable can then be referenced in the manifest or source xml files by enclosing it in curly braces and square braces (i.e. {[myvar]}).</p>

        <!-- SECTION => USAGE OVERVIEW - SOURCE FILE -->
        <section id="source-file">
            <title>Source File</title>

            <p>Source XML files to render must be located in the doc/xml directory. A source file contains the XML to display and execute.</p>
